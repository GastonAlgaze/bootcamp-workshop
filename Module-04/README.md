In this exercise you will learn how to deploy the web site you've been working on. We will use git-based deploy, meaning that we will create 

For this lab you will need a Windows Azure Account (<http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/>)

## Excercise 1 - Create the Windows Azure Web Site

1. Open the Windows Azure Management Portal 

2. Create a Web Site (+ -> Compute -> Web Site -> Quick Create) and enter a subdomain for the website

3. We will use git-based deployment, that means, that you will push your repo to a git repo hosted on Windows Azure.

4. Choose Local Git Repository.

    > If the account is new, it will ask you to create a username/password credential to protect the Git Repository.

5. Once the repo has been setup, follow the instructions to create the local repo, then commit and push to Azure.

> IMPORTANT: make sure you are currently sitting on the `Module-04/app` directory

        cd Module-04/app
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "initial commit"
        ## COPY THE GIT URL FROM THE AZURE PORTAL
        git remote add azure https://YOUR_USER@YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME.scm.azurewebsites.net/YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME-woloski.git
        git push azure master

6. If you go to the **DEPLOYMENTS** menu in the Windows Azure portal, you should see the deployment in progress.

If the deployment worked fine you can now browse to the website. However, it should fail because of two things: the callback configured in Auth0 is localhost (not the cloud) and also it is pointing to the dev mongo db. We will fix that in the next exercise.

## Exercise 2 - Configuration management

If you notice, your code has the database connection string and Auth0 configuration fixed in the code. Usually you want to keep those things in a configuration file so you can apply different values in dev and production (or other environments). In node.js the way you do that is using Environmnet variables that can be accesed through `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. Then, depending on the cloud you are deploying, you can set those environment variables somehow. In that way, only the administrator of the app will have the production configuration.

In this exercise we will change the current code to use those variables and then configure them in Windows Azure Web Site.

1. Go to `server.js` and modify the `getDb.init` line with:

        getDb.init({url: process.env.DB || 'mongodb://localhost/mymdocs'})

    > This is equivalent of "If there is an environment variable named DB, use that if not use mongodb://localhost..."

2. Then go to `lib/setupPassport.js` and modify the `clientID` and `clientSecret` to use the same approach.

        clientID:     process.env.AUTH0_CLIENTID || 'HERE IS YOUR DEV CLIENT ID',
        clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENTSECRET || 'HERE IS YOUR DEV CLIENT SECRET',
    
3. Commit and push to Windows Azure

        git commit -am "change to use env vars"
        git push azure master

4. Now, let's crate a database for production. Go to <http://mongolab.com>, login or create an account and then create a database like shown here.

5. Select the database just created and get the connection string, copy it to a text file somewhere

    ![](http://puu.sh/2HsM1.png)   
    > IMPORTANT: make sure to replace it with the right user and password.

6. Do the same for Auth0. Create a new application. 

    ![](http://puu.sh/2HsU8.png)

7. This time, set the callback URL to Windows Azure (`http://your-app.azurewebsites.net`)

    ![](http://puu.sh/2Ht0R.png)

8. Grab the Client ID and Secret from **Settings** and copy it to a text file.

    ![](http://puu.sh/2Hts4.png)

7. Now, go to your Windows Azure Web Site, to the **CONFIGURE** menu and paste the mongo DB connection string and Auth0 settings and click SAVE.

Wait till the app is saved and browse it again.

> If for some reason it is not working, click on the RESTART button.

**Congratulations!**

## Finshed early?

Windows Azure has a command line version to manage many aspects of the service. You can install it like this:

        npm install -g azure-cli

And you will be able to see realtime logs streamed. Every `console.log` in your app

        azure site log tail YOUR-APP

You can explore the rest of the things in the Windows Azure Web Site (like config your own domain, how to scale it, etc.)
