## Introduction

This workshop was prepared for the Global Windows Azure Bootcamp. We decided to do a node.js focused workshop, kind of like "startup-in-a-box". In this workshop we will go through creating a node.js application, deploy it to the cloud, adding persistance with MongoDB, authenticate users with social providers using [Auth0](http://auth0.com), making good use of GitHub and configure a continuous deployment environment with Jenkins

## Tools you'll need

1. node.js http://nodejs.org/download/ 

2. Text editor. We recommend:
    -  Sublime Text 2 http://www.sublimetext.com/2 
    -  Textmate (solo OSx) http://macromates.com/ 
    -  E-TextEditor (solo Windows) http://www.e-texteditor.com/ 

3. Git 
    -  windows and osx: http://git-scm.com/downloads 
    -  linux install with apt-get, yum or whatever package manager you use


## Modules

### Module 1 - Intro to Node and Express

In this module you will learn the basic usage of the [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

### Module 2 - MongoDB

In this module you will learn in these labs how to store documents in mongodb and query collections.

### Module 3 - Authentication

### Module 4 - Deploy to Windows Azure Web Sites

### Module 5 - GitHub

In this module, you will learn one way of using GitHub that has proven effective when working in teams. This same technique is being used by large development teams like GitHub themselves to build GitHub (and ourselves of course :)).

### Module 6 - Jenkins

In this module, you will learn how to create a Linux VM on Windows Azure with Jenkins and configure it to pull the source code from GitHub and push it to Windows Azure to create a continuous integration environment.
